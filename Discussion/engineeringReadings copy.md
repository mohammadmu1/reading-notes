## Engineering Readings

The one thing you bring to your career and a potential employer that nobody else can is your unique combination of skills, experiences, and perspectives. Each individual is different, and you have your own set of strengths and abilities that make you stand out in the workplace. Embrace your uniqueness and use it to your advantage to approach challenges in a distinct way.

To "un-stick" yourself whenever you get stuck on tough pieces of code, logic, or features, you can try the following three things:

Take a Break: Sometimes stepping away from the problem for a few minutes or even a few hours can give your brain the space it needs to refresh. Engage in a different activity, go for a walk, or do something you enjoy. Often, when you come back to the problem with a clear mind, you may see it from a new perspective.

Seek Help and Collaboration: Don't hesitate to ask for help or collaborate with colleagues. Explaining the issue to someone else can lead to new insights, and they might have encountered a similar problem before. Teamwork can lead to more efficient problem-solving and can also foster a positive and supportive work environment.

Break the Problem Down: If you're dealing with a complex issue, break it down into smaller, manageable parts. Focus on solving one piece at a time. Tackling smaller components can make the overall problem less overwhelming and allow you to make steady progress. Write down the steps you think are necessary to solve the problem, and cross them off as you complete them.

Remember, everyone faces challenges in their work, and getting stuck is a normal part of problem-solving. Be patient with yourself, stay persistent, and keep learning and growing. Over time, you'll build a toolkit of strategies to handle tough situations effectively.
