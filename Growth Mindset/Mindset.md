## Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

**Summary:**

Improving your technical skills requires deliberate practice. Merely building software daily does not guarantee progress. Deliberate practice involves pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone, repeating activities often, seeking feedback, and setting challenging goals. It demands mental effort and focuses on specific aspects of performance improvement. Unlike mindlessly playing through tasks, deliberate practice drills the most difficult parts. In the software development field, deliberate practice allows you to learn and apply new techniques, solve complex problems, and gain a deeper understanding. Constantly challenging yourself with deliberately designed exercises can significantly upgrade your technical skills and expand your capabilities in the field.


## the Growth Mindset

**Summary:**

Carol Dweck's concept of the growth mindset revolves around the power of "yet." Students at a high school in Chicago receive a grade of "Not Yet" if they fail a course, encouraging them to see challenges as part of a learning curve and providing a path into the future. Dweck's research showed that students with a growth mindset embraced challenges and understood that their abilities could be developed, while those with a fixed mindset saw failure as catastrophic. By fostering a growth mindset, students engage deeply with mistakes, learn from them, and persevere. Dweck urges educators and parents to praise effort, strategies, and improvement, rather than innate talent, to build resilience. Embracing the power of "yet" can transform students' mindsets, leading to improved academic performance and greater equality in education.

## Duckworth on Grit

**Summary:**

Angela Lee Duckworth's research on teaching seventh-grade math in New York City public schools led her to discover that IQ alone did not determine students' success. She became interested in understanding what makes students successful from a motivational and psychological perspective. Through various studies in challenging settings, Duckworth found that grit, defined as passion and perseverance for long-term goals, emerged as a significant predictor of success. Gritty individuals display stamina, sticking with their goals for years and working relentlessly to achieve them. Duckworth's research in Chicago public schools further confirmed that grittier students were more likely to graduate. However, while grit's importance is evident, there is limited scientific knowledge about how to build it in individuals. One potential approach is the concept of a growth mindset, which emphasizes that learning abilities can improve with effort. Duckworth emphasizes the need for further research and testing to better understand and cultivate grit in children and students.

## Redefining Success

**Summary:**

In this talk, Alain de Botton explores the concept of success and how it affects our lives in the modern world. He starts by sharing his personal experience of career crises and the anxiety that arises from the gap between one's hopes and the reality of their life. De Botton believes that we live in an age where career crises are common, and people often face anxiety about their jobs and status. He points out that snobbery and job snobbery, the dominant form of snobbery today, contribute to this anxiety. Moreover, the pursuit of meritocracy, the belief that talent and effort alone determine success, leads to envy and increased pressure on individuals to succeed. De Botton also highlights the lack of non-human centers in modern society and the need for nature to escape human competition and drama. He suggests that individuals should redefine their ideas of success to align with their own values and not succumb to societal pressures. By doing so, people can find genuine fulfillment and happiness, even if it means letting go of society's narrow definition of success.
