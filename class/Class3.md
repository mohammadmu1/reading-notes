## Primitives vs. Objects:

"int" vs. "Integer": int is a basic type for whole numbers, while Integer is an object that adds features to int.
Default Values: An uninitialized int is 0, and an Integer is null.



Autoboxing: Automatically turning a primitive type into its object form.
Unboxing: Automatically converting an object to its primitive type.

### Exceptions in Java: Three categories:

Checked Exceptions: Must be caught or declared with "throws." Expected and recoverable issues.
Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime): Occur during execution, often from unexpected errors.
Errors: Arise from external factors, not handled in application code.

### Exception Handling:

Use try-catch to handle exceptions.
Try Block: Contains code that might raise an exception.
Catch Block(s): Handles different types of exceptions.

### Scanner

Using Scanner for Text Input: Scanning helps with parsing, data extraction, language translation, etc.

Scanner breaks input into tokens based on delimiters (e.g., whitespace).
Tokenization: Breaking input into chunks (words, numbers) for organized processing.
