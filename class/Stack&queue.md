## Tutorial: Stack Operations Simplified

**Analogy:**
Imagine stacking books on a table. The last book you put on is the first one you'll take off. It's like a LIFO (Last In First Out) queue for books!

**Detail in Depth:**
In a stack, you can only add or remove items from the top. This follows the LIFO rule, meaning the last item added is the first one to go.

**WHY:**
Stacks are useful for managing actions you might want to undo, like in a text editor, or for tracking where you are in a maze.

**WHAT:**
A stack is a bunch of items piled on top of each other. You can only touch the top item.

**HOW - Push Operation:**
1. **WHAT:** Pushing is like adding a new item to the top.
2. **WHY:** It's like putting a new book on the stack.
3. **HOW:**
   - Put the new item on top.

**HOW - Pop Operation:**
1. **WHAT:** Popping is like taking the top item off.
2. **WHY:** It's like grabbing the top book.
3. **HOW:**
   - Take the top item and reveal the one below.

**Walk-Through Example:**
Imagine you're tracking your tasks with a stack.

1. **Push Operation:** You start with an empty stack.
   - Add "Work" on top.
   - Add "Study" on top.
   - The stack: [Study, Work]

2. **Pop Operation:** You finish studying and remove it.
   - The stack: [Work]

3. **Push Operation:** You add "Exercise."
   - The stack: [Exercise, Work]

**Quiz:**
1. What does LIFO mean in stack operations?
2. Which operation adds to the top of a stack?
3. Explain the book-stacking analogy.
4. How do you pop an item from a stack?
5. What's the significance of the "top" item?

**Cheat Sheet:**
- **Push:** Add on top.
- **Pop:** Remove from the top.
- **Top:** The most recent item.
- **LIFO:** Last In First Out.
- **Peek:** Look at the top item.
