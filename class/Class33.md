## Describe asynchronous actions in your own words.

Asynchronous actions in programming are like handling multiple tasks at once. Instead of waiting for each task to finish before starting the next one, you can kick off a task and move on to the next without waiting. It's like cooking on multiple burners at the same time instead of waiting for one pot to finish before starting another.

In the text, Java's CompletableFuture class is introduced to make it easier to work with these kinds of multitasking situations in a program.


## What is the benefit of asynchronous methods?

- **Improved Performance:** Non-blocking operations enhance efficiency and overall program performance.

- **Responsiveness:** Applications remain responsive during time-consuming tasks, ensuring a smoother user experience.

- **Scalability:** Asynchronous programming supports handling numerous tasks concurrently, promoting scalability.

- **Resource Utilization:** Non-blocking operations allow more effective use of system resources.

- **Concurrency:** Asynchronous methods facilitate the concurrent execution of multiple tasks.

- **Reduced Waiting Time:** Initiating and working on other tasks while waiting for slower operations minimizes waiting time.

- **Efficient Task Composition:** Asynchronous programming models, like CompletableFuture in Java, simplify composing and chaining tasks for complex workflows.
