OAuth is like a special key that lets your app access certain services on other websites, like logging in without sharing your secret password. 

In the tutorial, it shows how your app can use keys from two places:

1. GitHub: It's like using your GitHub account to log in to the app.
2. Google: You can also use your Google account to log in.

OAuth makes it easy for your app to connect with these places, so users can use their existing accounts to access your app, and it keeps their login info safe.
