## What makes a RecyclerView dynamic?
A **RecyclerView** is dynamic because it efficiently handles large sets of data by recycling views and loading items only when needed. This recycling process and on-demand loading make it responsive, reduce memory usage, and improve performance when displaying lists or grids of data in Android applications.
