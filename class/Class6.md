## Difference between an Object and a Class in Java:

Think of a class as a recipe card for making a sandwich. It tells you what ingredients to use and how to put them together. An object is like the actual sandwich you make by following that recipe. The class is the instructions, and the object is the tasty sandwich you can eat.

## Explanation of Inheritance in Java (Non-Technical):

Imagine you have a super talented friend who is a great dancer. You want to dance too, but you're just starting. Inheritance in Java is like your friend showing you some cool dance moves and letting you use them in your own dance routine.

It's like your friend saying, "Check out these awesome dance steps I know. You can use them in your dance and add your own flair!" So, you get to learn some cool moves from your friend and then put your own style into your dance. Inheritance lets you learn from their expertise and make it your own

## Static methods are also called what? Why?

Static methods are also called "class methods." They're like actions the whole class knows how to do. They don't need an object to work because they're part of the class itself. You use the class name to call them.

## How can you access a variable of a class without instantiating an object from that class?

Imagine there's a shared cookie jar in a class. You can take cookies from it without making your own jar. That's what happens with `static` variables. They're shared among all instances. So, you can directly use the class name to grab the value without needing an object.


## What is a Design Pattern?

A design pattern is like a "best way" guide for solving common problems in coding. It helps everyone build code that works well and makes sense.

**Analogy:** Think of it like following a set of rules when playing a game. Everyone knows how to play because they follow the same rules.

## One Design Pattern Example: Singleton Pattern

**What is a Singleton?**

A Singleton is like having a special, one-of-a-kind toy. It ensures there's only one of that toy for everyone to share.

**Analogy:** Imagine if everyone in a class had the same unique pencil. You wouldn't need to ask for a pencil; you'd know there's just one for everyone. In coding, a Singleton makes sure there's just one special thing for everyone to use.

## Another Design Pattern Example: Factory Pattern

**What is a Factory Pattern?**

A Factory is like a magic machine that makes things. You tell it what you want, and it creates that thing for you.

**Analogy:** It's like going to a candy store and saying, "I want something sweet." The store owner gives you a candy without you needing to know how to make it. In coding, a Factory helps create things without you needing to build them from scratch.
