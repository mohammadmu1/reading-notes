Tasks and the back stack in Android can be likened to a stack of plates. When you place a new plate (activity) on top of the stack, it becomes the one you interact with. If you remove the top plate (by tapping Back), you reveal the one beneath it, which represents the previous activity. Just like in Android, you work with the top plate (activity) in your stack of plates, and as you remove plates, you expose the one below.

A similar system can be found in our daily lives when stacking physical objects. For example, when you stack books, dishes, or even paperwork, you are essentially creating a "stack" where the top item is the one you currently interact with, and you access the items beneath it by removing the top one. This concept mirrors how Android manages tasks and the back stack for a seamless user experience.
